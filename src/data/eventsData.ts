      "The $IMG community voted in favor of a temporary tax adjustment to strengthen the project during these early stages of growth. The new structure allocates 2.5% to the Infra Wallet and 2.5% to holders. This flexible system is designed to support ongoing development while ensuring long-term sustainability for the project.",
    content: `## Why a Temporary Tax Structure?

At lower market caps, even small trading volumes can make it difficult to fund critical development, marketing, and infrastructure. To solve this, the community voted to temporarily adjust the tax split:

- Holders: 2.5%
- Infra Wallet: 2.5%

This ensures that while holders still earn significant $SOL rewards, a larger share goes into the Infra Wallet, funding essential upgrades and growth strategies that benefit everyone long-term.

## How the Infra Wallet Builds Value

The Infra Wallet is the project's backbone. It has already been used to:

âœ… Build new liquidity pools like IMG/BONK and IMG/USDC, generating more trading volume.

âœ… Fund marketing campaigns to attract new holders.

âœ… Pay for development upgrades, including improvements to the rewards script.

âœ… Sponsor events and promotions to grow visibility.

This reinvestment creates a positive feedback loop: stronger infrastructure â†’ more volume â†’ more tax collected â†’ more rewards and growth.

## Liquidity Pools = Volume Engine

One of the biggest benefits of boosting the Infra Wallet has been the ability to launch new trading pairs.

- IMG/BONK Pool ($5K) â†’ generates $7,500â€“$30,000 daily volume.
- IMG/ETH Pool ($5K) â†’ attracts ETH whales, adds $5,000â€“$20,000 daily volume.
- IMG/USDC Pool ($10K) â†’ provides routing backbone for CEX/DEX arbitrage.

As more pools are added, arbitrage bots trade nonstop between them, driving consistent daily volume and tax revenue. This directly benefits holders by:

ðŸ”¹ Increasing trading activity & visibility.

ðŸ”¹ Lowering slippage â†’ better experience for traders.

ðŸ”¹ Generating higher tax income â†’ more rewards + more funds for growth.

Even small pools ($2Kâ€“$5K) can generate 5xâ€“10x their size in daily volume.

## Flexible Tax Based on Marketcap

After another community vote, we introduced a flexible tax model that adjusts as the project grows:

- Under $3M Marketcap â†’ 2.5% holders / 2.5% infra wallet
- $3Mâ€“$5M â†’ 3% holders / 2% infra wallet
- $5Mâ€“$7.5M â†’ 3.5% holders / 1.5% infra wallet
- $7.5Mâ€“$10M â†’ 4% holders / 1% infra wallet
- $10M+ â†’ 4.5% holders / 0.5% infra wallet

This approach ensures:

âœ… Strong funding when the project is small and needs it most.

âœ… Gradual return to normal rewards as marketcap grows.

âœ… Long-term sustainability, with the Infra Wallet always receiving 0.5% at $10M+ to keep development funded forever.

## The Bigger Picture

This flexible tax structure is temporary and designed for sustainability. As marketcap grows, rewards gradually shift back toward holders while still maintaining a small but steady Infra Wallet allocation to fund development.

Bottom line:

ðŸ“Œ Temporary boost to build stronger foundations.

ðŸ“Œ Flexible system that adapts to market growth.

ðŸ“Œ Self-sustaining model at scale with 0.5% Infra Wallet.

With this strategy, $IMG is building a sustainable reward ecosystem that grows alongside its holders â€” creating value today, and ensuring development for tomorrow.`,

      "The server has been upgraded to improve stability and support the growing database. Next milestone: optimizing the database to reduce bandwidth and memory usage. Auditing tools are also in development to strengthen reliability.",
    content: `Server Optimization Upgrade: Stronger, Smarter, More Reliable

The $IMG infrastructure has received a major server upgrade to improve stability, handle the growing database, and ensure the reward system remains reliable as the project scales.

## Why the Upgrade Was Needed

The rewards system has already processed over 13,099 transactions. With such growth, the database reached 12 million records, which began slowing down queries and affecting efficiency. On top of that, some unaccounted transactions appeared due to Solana API issues, requiring deeper auditing.

To handle this scale, the server was upgraded to meet memory and bandwidth requirements â€” ensuring smoother operation for both the rewards script and the dashboard.

## What's Being Worked On

- Reconcile Phase â€“ A new step in the rewards process will verify wallet balances against expected values, eliminating mismatches and improving accuracy.
- Spam Airdrop Filtering â€“ A script is being built to identify and remove spam airdrops from transaction history, keeping records clean.
- Accrual Distribution System â€“ An "add-on" script in development will automatically track and re-distribute any skipped or pending rewards, so no holder is left behind.

## Rewards Flow (New & Improved)

The upgraded process will now follow four phases:

1. Harvest â€“ Collect IMG fees.
2. Allocation â€“ Convert to SOL.
3. Distribution â€“ Pay rewards to holders.
4. Reconcile â€“ Confirm balances match on-chain expectations.

## Why This Matters for Holders

- Stronger reliability â†’ fewer missed transactions, smoother rewards.
- Better accuracy â†’ every SOL accounted for, no holder overlooked.
- Future-proof scaling â†’ optimized database ensures the system can keep growing.
- Community trust â†’ full transparency and clean execution, all verifiable on-chain.

This upgrade ensures $IMG continues to build a sustainable, resilient, and transparent rewards ecosystem, benefitting every single holder.

Next milestone: optimizing the database further to reduce bandwidth and memory usage â€” paving the way for seamless growth.`,

      "Rewards are harvested hourly and distributed daily at 2 AM, 8 AM, 2 PM, and 8 PM EST. Payouts roll out gradually, so while not every wallet receives rewards at those exact times, all holders receive their full share by day's end, execution is on-chain and verifiable.",
    content: `Reward System Upgrade: Smarter, Fairer, Stronger

The $IMG reward system has been upgraded to provide more efficient payouts, lower fees, and a smoother experience for all holders.

This upgrade was decided by community vote on Telegram â€” a true community-led step forward.

## Why the Change?

Previously, rewards were distributed every 5 minutes. While fast, this method caused:

- Unnecessary transaction fees piling up
- Higher risk of Solana blockchain congestion during peak activity
- Frequent small reward transfers that weren't efficient for holders

To solve this, the system now uses a fixed distribution schedule four times daily.

## How It Works Now

- Harvesting: Rewards are harvested hourly, with $IMG fees converted to $SOL in small batches (avoiding large sell-offs).
- Distribution: Rewards are paid out at 2 AM, 8 AM, 2 PM, and 8 PM EST.
- Rolling Payouts: Not every wallet receives SOL at the exact times, but all holders get their full rewards by day's end.
- On-Chain Transparency: Every step is executed and verifiable directly on-chain.

## Why This is Better for Holders

- Bigger, juicier payouts (4 times daily vs. tiny amounts every 5 minutes)
- Lower transaction costs â†’ more value stays in the system
- Less stress on Solana â†’ smoother and more reliable reward flow
- Smarter harvesting â†’ IMG converted to SOL gradually, not in large dumps

## Designed for the Community

This upgrade balances efficiency and fairness, ensuring rewards are distributed in a way that strengthens $IMG's long-term sustainability while maximizing value for holders.

The result: smoother operations, fewer fees, and stronger rewards â€” all decided by the community.`,

    content: `Blacklist Wallets: A Major Upgrade for Fair Rewards

We're excited to introduce an important upgrade to the $IMG reward system: Blacklist Wallets.

This system ensures that rewards are distributed fairly by excluding wallets that should not be receiving them, such as DEX liquidity pools, exchange hot wallets, and fee wallets. Instead of rewards being wasted on inactive or platform-controlled wallets, they are redirected to real $IMG holders.

## What Are Blacklist Wallets?

The rewards script now automatically blacklists certain addresses, including:

- CoinEx hot wallet
- Raydium liquidity pools
- Phantom fee wallet
- And other similar exchange-related wallets

By excluding these wallets, the system prevents rewards from being sent to places where they provide no benefit to the community.

## How It Helps Holders

- Rewards are distributed only among true $IMG holders
- Prevents wasted payouts to liquidity pools and exchanges
- Increases individual rewards by narrowing the eligible pool of recipients

This means more SOL is sent directly to wallets that actually hold $IMG, strengthening the fairness and value of the ecosystem.

## How It Works (On-Chain & Transparent)

The rewards script fully automates the process:

- Scans the blockchain for wallet balances
- Harvests rewards
- Converts IMG tax into SOL
- Distributes SOL to all eligible (non-blacklisted) holders

All steps are executed on-chain and can be verified publicly.

## A Flexible & Evolving System

Blacklist Wallets is not static â€” the system can add or remove addresses as needed. As the project grows, more exchange or platform wallets may be blacklisted to ensure rewards always benefit the community first.

## Why This Matters

This update marks a big step toward making the reward system more efficient, fair, and sustainable. It ensures that $IMG continues to deliver maximum value to holders, rather than rewarding inactive or platform-controlled addresses.

With this upgrade, $IMG proves once again that it is committed to innovation, transparency, and community-first development.`,

With more than 12 years of full-stack engineering and tech lead experience, Jerry brings the expertise and vision needed to take $IMG's infrastructure, rewards system, and long-term sustainability to the next level.

## GitHub â€“ Jerry Balderas

[@https://github.com/midnjerry](https://github.com/midnjerry)

## Jerry's Mission at $IMG

Jerry's primary focus will be on:
- Building a high-performance, redundant rewards distribution script
- Creating tax-optimized systems to maximize long-term project value
- Strengthening the technical foundation for $IMG's growth

He has previously developed trading platforms with advanced backtesting and even a real-time auditing prototype: IMG Audit Demo

## From Jerry Himself:

"First and foremost, thank you all for your recommendation. I've been praying long and hard and although it's a great responsibility, I am honored and excited to step in.

My goal with the distribution script is obviously high-redundancy performance, but I'm looking at this as a marathon. I'm currently in the process of setting up tax vehicles to incorporate a Self-Directed IRA (SDIRA) framework. Imagine an auto-compounding trading engine (with no capital gains) which doubles every year, but also takes profits and buys $IMG.

Not only am I bringing maintenance, but I'm also building a framework that will create a tax-optimized revenue stream for consistent $IMG buybacks. This is a marathon, and if we stay the course, we will bless many people."*

## Why This Is Big for $IMG

Jerry isn't just maintaining and upgrading the system â€” he's helping $IMG evolve into a self-sustaining ecosystem.

âœ… Stronger, more reliable distribution mechanics
âœ… New tax-optimized structures to support buybacks
âœ… A forward-looking strategy for scalability and growth

With Jerry onboard, $IMG is doubling down on long-term development, transparency, and innovation. This marks a huge step forward in ensuring $IMG remains one of the most sustainable and community-driven projects in crypto.`,

    content: `The $IMG community has spoken! By majority vote on our official Telegram, the community decided to introduce an Infrastructure Wallet (Infra Wallet) a transparent, on-chain solution designed to strengthen the project and ensure long-term sustainability.

## What is the Infra Wallet?

The Infra Wallet collects 0.5% from every buy, sell, and transfer (out of the 5% transaction tax). These funds are fully transparent on-chain and can be tracked by anyone in the community.

Unlike hidden or centralized funding models, the Infra Wallet makes sure every token holder knows exactly where resources are going â€” creating trust and accountability at the heart of the $IMG ecosystem.

## Why It Matters

The purpose of the Infra Wallet is simple:
to fuel growth, strengthen infrastructure, and support ongoing development, making $IMG more sustainable in the long run.

Funds from the Infra Wallet are being used for:

- Infrastructure operations and upgrades
- Paid marketing campaigns & social promotions
- Updating Dexscreener and other tracking platforms
- Paying developers to improve the rewards script
- Third-party audits & CEX listing fees
- Launching new liquidity pools (IMG/BONK, IMG/USDC, and more)

Even several whales have contributed additional support, helping accelerate these efforts and expand the reach of $IMG.

## Community-Backed Rewards System

The Infra Wallet works hand-in-hand with the automatic Solana rewards system, another upgrade chosen directly by community vote.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- 5% tax on all transactions
- 4.5% goes directly back to holders
- 0.5% goes to the Infra Wallet
- 100% of the collected tax is converted into Solana

Rewards are harvested hourly and distributed daily at 2 AM, 8 AM, 2 PM, and 8 PM EST

All execution is on-chain and verifiable â€” no claiming required
By combining automated Solana rewards with the Infra Wallet, $IMG achieves both immediate value for holders and long-term growth for the project.

## A Community-Led Future

The addition of the Infra Wallet shows exactly what makes $IMG different: every major decision is guided by the community.

With transparency, sustainability, and growth at its core, the Infra Wallet ensures $IMG is built to last.

This is only the beginning, with the Infra Wallet in place, $IMG is positioned to expand faster, scale smarter, and deliver even more value to its community.`,
